# The-Tech-Academy-JavaScript-Coding-Projects
Repository for large coding projects in JavaScript

This is the major JavaScript Project I developed while at the Tech Academy.  It mimics a pizza company with an online order site.  

The JavaScript code allows the program to accept user input and use that input to calculate a running total for the pizza order.

Finally, the website displays the itemized order and the total price for the customer.
